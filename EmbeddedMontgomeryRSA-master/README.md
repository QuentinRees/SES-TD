# EmbeddedMontgomeryRSA
An optimized C implementation of the RSA public key encryption using the Montgomery Multiplication algorithm.

## RSA and Modular Exponentiation
The RSA operations for encryption and decryption involve modular exponentiation: X^Y mod M.

  * _C_: Ciphertext
  * _P_: PlainText
  * _e_: Public Exponent
  * _d_: Private Exponent
  * _M_: modulo

  - _C = P<sup>e</sup> mod M_   (encrypt with public key)
  - _P = C<sup>d</sup> mod M_   (decrypt with private key)
  
  The public key is (_e_,_M_) and the private key is (_d_,_M_).

### Generation of Modulus (M)
Choose two prime numbers with half the bit-length of the desired public/private keys.

* _p_: prime
* _q_: prime
* _M = p x q_
  
See [https://www.mobilefish.com/services/rsa_key_generation/rsa_key_generation.php] for more information.
  
### Generation of Public Exponent (e)
The public exponent (_e_) is a small integer. 
Valid choices are 3, 5, 7, 17, 257, or 65537.  
With RSA keys the public exponent is usually 65537.

The requirements for _e_ are: 
* 1 < _e_ < phi(_M_) = (_p_ - 1) * (_q_ - 1)
* _e_ and Euler's phi(_M_) function are coprime.

### Generaion of Private Exponent (d)
The private exponent is generated from primes _p_ and _q_ and the public exponent.
* _d_ = _e_-1 mod (_p_ - 1) * (_q_ - 1)

## Efficient Modular Exponentiation (using Montgomery Multiplication)
The multiply and square algorithm for Modular Exponentiation requires modular multiplication in the forms:
  - _Z = X * X mod M_
  - _Z = X * Y mod M_

This operation requires expensive multiplication and division operations. 
Montgomery Multiplication converts parameters into modular residues wherein multiplication becomes addition and division becomes a bitwise shift.

Modular residues require a pre computed value (R), related to the size of the modulus (_M_):
* _R<sup>2m</sup> = 2<sup>2m</sup> mod M_, where _m_ = # bits of in the modulus (_M_)

The bitwise Montgomery Multiplication algorithm uses the equation:
* X (residue) = X * _R_<sup>2m</sup> * (_R_<sup>-1</sup>) mod _M_ 

This bitwise algorithm internally calculates the modular inverse (R<sup>-1</sup>). 
The modular inverse is defined as R<sup>-1</sup> where R * R<sup>-1</sup> mod _M_ = 1.
